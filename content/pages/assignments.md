Reading Presentation
--------------------

In an effort to promote lively classroom discussion and encourage students to do the reading, each student will sign up to do a very short 10-minute presentation of the day's discussion case which are posted on the course website. These cases are often newspaper clippings or other popular media which show the relevance and complexity of the issues being discussed in class.

The presentations can address the following questions to help get the day's discussion get started:

1.  What was your initial reaction in reading about the situation?
2.  What are some of the underlying assumptions being made?
3.  What tradeoffs are involved?
4.  What are some questions you wanted to ask?
